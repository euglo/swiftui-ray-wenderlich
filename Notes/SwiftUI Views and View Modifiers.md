# SwuiftUI Views and View Modifiers

- More View Modifiers
  - Padding, foreground color, background, corner radius
  - Background - can use any View for color
    - Background color: background color of button
    - Foreground: color of text
    - Padding: space around text
  - Important to apply padding *before* background color
    - Padding applies transparent space around the view
- Colors and Gradients
  - SwiftUI sizes its layout dynamically according to just how much is needed
    - Initially fill up as much as possible
  - Safe area by default above
    - Ignore: `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)` 
  - Can either use a custom color or import from Asset Catalog (preferred)
    - Asset Catalog lets you use one location for everywhere
      - `AccentColor`: Gives special color to controls (i.e. slider)
    - Adapts to dark mode if specified
  - Gradient: use `LinearGradient`
- Dark Mode
- Extract Views
  - Contain views, have pre-styling
- Fills and Stroke
  - Drawing shapes
    - Set to specific height: `.frame()`
      - Shape is drawn as big as it can be within that space
    - Specific color: `.fill()`
  - By default, half of stroke is on the left and other half is on the right of the line
    - Fix 1: `.inset(by: 10.0)`
      - Shrinks shape down by specified amount
    - Fix 2 (specific for border, preferred): `.strokeBorder()`
  - Providing a border to the button: `.overlay()` with rounded rectable with `strokeBorder()`
